Kyle:

We'er trying to capture iregular surfaces whichi may include objects with planed faces and continuous shpaes (see attached photo)

the problem we;re experiencing is that we're getting stisfacotry resutls with contunous shapes but we are not beign able to scan groups of boxes and cones.

is there any contraint with thte algorithm you're sugn that coudl explain the above experimental results? or is just us doing something wrong?

just fro you to know, we tried with differetn projected patterns, allways three-phase, an we get the same result.



Mapping:
We're working on developing an automatic video/mapping modeling tool and we're interested on gather some requirements you could be interested in to inlcude as part of the scope ot the project.

the poroject consists of three stages: 
1) scan: this is an automated geometry scan process that will "export" the shape to an standard 3D representation (OBJ, etc)
2) edition: manipulation to the 3D representation. eventually you'd like to cut the shape, adjust some unacuracies product of the automatic process (step 1). We're very open to suggestions here :)
3) mapping: GUI to project videos, images, effects over the 3D shape. Strongly cupled or integrated within the same tool with the "editio" step 2.

we're also interested in knowing how you do all these tasks today, what products/tools you use and if you have comments or suggestions to the presentd steps or if you can propose a completely different way of doing them.

you can see where we are today (research stage yet) and what are the things we tried and their results.
